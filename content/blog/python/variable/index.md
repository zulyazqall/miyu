Variable is like container or box to store something, so the variables are containers to store data of different types like numbers, strings, boolean, lists, etc.

## Python Variable

```python
# Let's say you have a box to store things.
# You can give the box a name, like "box".
# Here, "box" is a variable.

box = "fruits"
print(box)  

# Variables can store different types of things too.
# For example, you can store numbers in a variable.
number = 9
print(number)  

# You can also combine variables together.
message = "Hello, " + "World!"
print(message) 
```
**Output**
```python
fruits
9
Hello, World!
```
