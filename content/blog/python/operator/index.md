Operators are unique symbols that are used to perform calculations on numbers and other information. They help us add numbers together, compare values, or change the variables' values.

## Python Operators

```
  Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **, //)
  Assignment operators (==, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=)
  Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
  Logical operators (and, or, not)
  Identity operators (is, isnot)
  Membership operators (in, not in)
  Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
```

## Let's Code

```python
x = 5   
y = 9  

print("Arithmetic: ", x + y)
print("Comparison : ", x > y)
```
**Output**
```python
Arithmetic: 14
Comparison: False
```
