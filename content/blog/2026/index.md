## Teaching Plan 
Teaching plan for IT and Robotics Class 2026, included study plan, worksheet and project. 

## Why Robotics Matters in Education
Robotics education offers a unique blend of hands-on learning, computational thinking, and creative expression. Students develop:

**Problem-solving** skills through debugging and iteration
**Collaboration** abilities via team-based projects
**Technical literacy** in coding and engineering concepts
**Communication skills** when presenting their creations
**Confidence** through tangible, interactive achievements

### Grade 1 and 2
approach the world with boundless curiosity and imagination. At this foundational stage, robotics should feel magical and exploratory, introducing basic concepts through play-based learning.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Cause and effect relationships
- Sequential thinking
- Basic storytelling and narrative structure
- Following simple directions
  
### Grade 3 to 5
Elementary students are ready to transition from pure discovery to more structured problem-solving. This is where robotics becomes a powerful vehicle for developing computational thinking while maintaining the joy of creation.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Introduction to programming logic
- Basic loops and conditional thinking
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Reflection and iteration

### Grade 6 to 8
Middle school represents a crucial transition period where students crave independence and real-world relevance. Robotics programs can channel this energy into collaborative innovation and deeper technical understanding.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Advanced programming concepts
- Sensor integration and conditional logic
- Team-based project management
- Design thinking methodology
