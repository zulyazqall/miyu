Computational thinking is a way of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller parts, finding patterns, and creating step-by-step solutions.

Why it’s important: "It helps us solve problems in school, work, and everyday life!"

## The 4 Parts of Computational Thinking

1. Decomposition: Breaking a problem into smaller parts.
2. Pattern Recognition: Finding similarities or patterns.
3. Abstraction: Focusing on the important details and ignoring the rest.
4. Algorithm Design: Creating step-by-step instructions to solve the problem.



### Decomposition in Action

Example: "Planning a birthday party: Break it into tasks like sending invitations, buying decorations, and preparing food."

Activity: "Let’s decompose a problem together!"

### Pattern Recognition in Action

Example: "Finding patterns in math problems, music, or even nature!"

Activity: "Can you spot the pattern in this sequence?"

### Abstraction in Action

Example: "Drawing a map: Focus on important landmarks, not every single tree or house."

Activity: "What details are important when drawing a map of your school?"

### Algorithm Design in Action

Example: "Writing a recipe: Step-by-step instructions to bake a cake."

Activity: "Let’s create an algorithm for brushing your teeth!"

## Real-Life Applications of Computational Thinking

Examples:

- Solving math problems.

- Organizing a school project.

- Coding a video game or app.

## Let’s Practice Computational Thinking!
Interactive activity: "Solve this problem using decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design!"

## Wrap-Up and Questions
